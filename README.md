For my thesis I want to compare deep learning models (LSTM) with traditional machine learning models for predicting student performance.
I hypothesize that LSTMs will be able to predict student performance more accurately than traditional machine learning models.

If you want to run the code, first download the OULAD dataset here:

Kuzilek J., Hlosta M., Zdrahal Z. Open University Learning Analytics dataset Sci. Data 4:170171 doi: 10.1038/sdata.2017.171 (2017).

It is important to first run the data transformation file, because it creates a csv file that is required for the other R file.
