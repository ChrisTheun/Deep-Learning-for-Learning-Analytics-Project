Purpose of files:

- Data Transformation v3.R: Transform the original Open University UK data into a format suitable for analysis and exploration [Output: studentInfo_v3.csv]
- Data Exploration v2.R: Exploring the student data in order to find some additional insights [complemented with Tableau]
- Model_wDistinction.R: Developing traditional machine learning models to predict 3 classes of student performance [fail/pass/pass with distinction]
- Model_WithoutDistinction.R: Developing traditional machine learning models to predict 2 classes of student performance [fail/pass]

NOTE: Most of these files require the original source dataset to run, which was too large to add to gitHub.
