Data Transformation.R uses the OULAD public dataset available at https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset
The data is transformed, cleaned and aggregated in separate datasets that are then used in the LSTM FORMATTING.ipynb file in order to perform the final transformations needed.
After the code in these two files has been executed, the data files required for the modeling are created.

R and Python are required
