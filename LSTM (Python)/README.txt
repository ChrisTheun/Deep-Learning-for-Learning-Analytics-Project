Purpose of Jupyter notebooks:


- LSTM 2 CLASSES.ipynb: Developing a LSTM model to predict 2 classes of student performance [fail/pass] (without auxiliary input)

- LSTM 3 CLASSES.ipynb: Developing a LSTM model to predict 3 classes of student performance [fail/pass/pass with distinction] (without auxiliary input)

- LSTM 2 CLASSES AUX.ipynb: Developing a LSTM model with student background information as auxiliary input to predict 2 classes of student performance [fail/pass]

- LSTM 3 CLASSES AUX.ipynb: Developing a LSTM model with student background information as auxiliary input to predict 3 classes of student performance [fail/pass/pass with distinction]
